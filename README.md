Parking Spot Detection


## Problem statement
In pursuance to the huge population, India has a problem of insufficient parking space. With families getting smaller and the total number of motor vehicles exceeding the total number of heads per family, the parking scenario is woefully falling short of the current requirements in the country. The situation is such that on any given day, approximately 40% of the roads in urban India are taken up for just as parking space. The number of families with cars has become much more than what the country is able to manage.

## New Ideas Incorporated

- Instead of just reserving the spot in a parking lot, we will give the user the live available spaces in the parking along so that user can easily get to the locations without wasting time, effort, fuel and last minute hurries.

- The existing techniques uses hardware in performing the task, which incurs some initial costs and can easily lead to failure.

- Our idea uses no extra costs but simply uses the CCTV footage that too will not be shown to maintain privacy.

## Technologies we used..

- Artificial Intelligence

- Computer Vision

- Flutter

- Flask
