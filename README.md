Parking Spot Detection


## Problem statement
In pursuance to the huge population, India has a problem of insufficient parking space. With families getting smaller and the total number of motor vehicles exceeding the total number of heads per family, the parking scenario is woefully falling short of the current requirements in the country. The situation is such that on any given day, approximately 40% of the roads in urban India are taken up for just as parking space. The number of families with cars has become much more than what the country is able to manage.
